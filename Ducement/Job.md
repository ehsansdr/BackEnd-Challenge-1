The `@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?")` annotation in Spring is used to schedule a task to run at specific times according to the cron expression you provide. In this case, the cron expression "0 0 0 * * ?" represents a schedule for running the task at midnight every day.

Breaking down the Cron Expression
A cron expression is made up of 6 or 7 fields, depending on the system. In Spring, the format used is:

sql
Copy

    second minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week year

0 0 0 * * ? Explained:
0 (second): At the 0th second (start of the minute).
0 (minute): At the 0th minute (start of the hour).
0 (hour): At the 0th hour (midnight).
* (day-of-month): Every day of the month.
  * (month): Every month.
    ? (day-of-week): The question mark (?) is used as a placeholder and means "no specific value" for the day of the week. It is used when the day of the month (*) is already specified.
    So, the cron expression "0 0 0 * * ?" means:
    At 00:00:00 (midnight) every day.
    What it does
    The method annotated with @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?") will execute at exactly midnight each day.
    For example, the scheduled task will run at 12:00:00 AM every day, and it will execute the code inside the method at that exact time.
    Example
    java
    Copy
    
        @Component
        public class TransactionSummaryTask {

            @Autowired
            private TransactionRepository transactionRepository;
        
            @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?")  // Run at midnight every day
            public void printDailyTransactionSummary() {
            // Get the start of the day (midnight) for today
            LocalDateTime startOfDay = LocalDateTime.now().toLocalDate().atStartOfDay();
        
                  // Get all transactions that happened after the start of today
                  List<Transaction> transactions = transactionRepository.findAllByTransactionDateAfter(startOfDay);
        
                  // Calculate the total transaction amount for the day
                  BigDecimal totalAmount = transactions.stream()
                                                       .map(Transaction::getAmount)
                                                       .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
        
                  System.out.println("Total amount of transactions for the day: " + totalAmount);
            }
        }
  * 
    This task will run daily at midnight and calculate the total amount of transactions for that day.

Notes:
Time Zone: The scheduled task runs according to the system's default time zone. If you want to specify a different time zone, you can use the zone attribute in the annotation like this:


    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?", zone = "UTC")
This will make the task run at midnight UTC every day.

Fixed Delay vs. Cron: If you need to run the task periodically with a fixed delay (e.g., every 30 minutes), you can use the @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 1800000) annotation instead of using a cron expression.
