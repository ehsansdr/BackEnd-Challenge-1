Got it! Since you're using Spring and Maven for your project, I'll guide you step by step to Dockerize your Spring Boot application along with the MySQL database.

Step-by-Step Guide to Dockerizing Your Spring Boot Project with MySQL
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
   First, make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

Install Docker
Install Docker Compose
2. Build the Spring Boot Application with Maven
   Before you dockerize your Spring Boot app, make sure the application is built using Maven.

Navigate to your Spring Boot project directory /home/novin/IdeaProjects/WalletManager.

Use Maven to build your application by running:

bash
Copy

      mvn clean package

This will generate a .jar file (e.g., WalletManager.jar) in the target/ directory.

3. Create a Dockerfile
   Next, you need to create a Dockerfile in the root of your project. This file will define how to build your application’s Docker image.

Here’s an example Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy

      # Use a base image with OpenJDK (since Spring Boot requires Java)
      FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
      
      # Set the working directory inside the container
      WORKDIR /app
      
      # Copy the Spring Boot jar file into the container (adjust the path if necessary)
      COPY target/WalletManager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/WalletManager.jar
      ### make shoe for the target/ use the exact .jar file that created by mvn clean package in te target instead you will get error

      # Expose the port that Spring Boot will run on (default is 8080)
      EXPOSE 8080
      
      # Command to run the Spring Boot app
      CMD ["java", "-jar", "WalletManager.jar"]

4. Create a docker-compose.yml File
   To run both your Spring Boot app and MySQL in separate containers, we’ll use Docker Compose. The docker-compose.yml file will define both services: your Spring Boot application and the MySQL database.

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root of your project:


      
      version: '3.8'
      
      services:
      app:
      build: .
      container_name: walletmanager-app # the name of the container that you can create tat the end and see that with sudo docker ps -a
      ports:
      - "8080:8080" # when you run the docker and the server at the same time you will get error in one of them that the port is already in use
      depends_on:
        - db
        environment:
        SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:mysql://db:3306/WalletManageDB
        SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: root
        SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: password
        SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO: update
        SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
        networks:
        - walletnetwork
      
      db:
      image: mysql:8.0
      container_name: walletmanager-db
      environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: WalletManageDB
      ports:
      - "3306:3306" # when you run the docker and the server at the same time you will get error in one of them that the port is already in use i do not know you can change or not
      networks:
        - walletnetwork
        volumes:
        - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
      
      networks:
      walletnetwork:
      driver: bridge
      
      volumes:
      mysql_data:
      driver: local
Explanation of the docker-compose.yml file:

app: This is your Spring Boot app container. It’s built from the Dockerfile we created.

      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: Points to the MySQL database (db is the service name).
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: Username for MySQL (root).
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: Password for MySQL (password).
      db: This is your MySQL database container.
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Password for the root user (password).
      MYSQL_DATABASE: The name of the database to create (walletmanager).

like : application.yml
      
            #server:
      #  port: 8081 # basic is 8080
      spring:
      datasource:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/WalletManageDB
      username: root
      password: '!QAZ1qaz' # if you have pass word like this spring detect that as tag not pass so use '' to prevent that
      driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
      sql:
      init:
      mode: always
      #    hikari:
      #      # This property defines the maximum number of connections that can be held in the pool. Setting this appropriately can improve application performance by reusing existing connections.
      #      maximum-pool-size: 10
      #      # This property specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) that the driver will wait for a connection from the pool. If no connection is available within the timeout period, an exception will be thrown.
      #      connection-timeout: 3000
      
      jpa:
      # have this in mysql connecting for not getting : org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'entityManagerFactory' defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/HibernateJpaConfiguration.class]: [PersistenceUnit: default] Unable to build Hibernate SessionFactory; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: Unable to build DatabaseInformation [Unknown table 'SEQUENCES' in information_schema] [n/a]
      properties:
      hibernate.dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
      hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
      format_sql: true
      database: mysql
      show-sql: true
      
      logging:
      level:
      root: INFO

for better indent see application.yml in project

depends_on: Ensures that the MySQL database starts before your Spring Boot application.
volumes: The MySQL database data is persisted in a volume (mysql_data) so that it is not lost when the container is stopped or removed.
5. Configure Your Spring Boot Application for Docker
   Make sure your application.properties or application.yml is set up to use the MySQL container’s settings.

For example, in your src/main/resources/application.properties, you should configure the MySQL connection like this:

properties
Copy

      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/walletmanager
      spring.datasource.username=root
      spring.datasource.password=password
      spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
      spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
      spring.jpa.show-sql=true
      spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always

This configuration ensures that Spring Boot connects to the db container, which is the MySQL service defined in docker-compose.yml.

6. Build and Run Your Application with Docker
   Now that you’ve created the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file, follow these steps:

Navigate to your project root directory /home/novin/IdeaProjects/WalletManager.

Build the containers by running the following command:

bash

      sudo docker-compose build


      sudo docker-compose build

It looks like the Docker image for your application (walletmanager-app) was built successfully, and the image is ready to be run!

After the build process is done, start the containers by running:

bash
Copy

      sudo docker-compose up

in thr consule you will see this:

      sudo docker-compose up
      [+] Running 0/1
      ⠴ db Pulling   




![Screenshot from 2025-01-27 17-04-46.png](../../Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-27%2017-04-46.png)

It looks like your Docker Compose process is still in the "pulling" stage, which means Docker is downloading the required images. This can sometimes take a while, depending on your internet connection and the size of the Docker images.

Here’s a breakdown of what might be happening:

Pulling images: Docker is trying to download the necessary images (in this case, MySQL and your application image) from the Docker Hub. Sometimes large images or slow internet connections can make this step take a while.
Waiting: This might indicate that some of the images are waiting for others to finish downloading before they can continue.


This command will:

*    Build the Docker image for your Spring Boot application.
*    Start both the Spring Boot application and MySQL database containers.

7. Verify the Application is Running
   Once the containers are up and running, you should be able to access your Spring Boot application at:

arduino
Copy
   
       http://localhost:8080
Also, the MySQL database will be available at localhost:3306, and your Spring Boot app will use the database based on the connection settings we defined.

8. Stopping the Containers
   When you’re done working with the containers, you can stop them by running:

bash
Copy

      docker-compose down
This will stop and remove the containers, but your MySQL data will persist in the mysql_data volume.

Optional: Make the Docker Image Smaller
If you want to make your Docker image smaller, you can use a multi-stage build. Here’s an updated Dockerfile that builds your Spring Boot app in one stage and runs it in a smaller image:

dockerfile
Copy

      # Stage 1: Build the app
      FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-17-slim AS build
      
      WORKDIR /app
      
      COPY . .
      
      RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

      # Stage 2: Run the app
      FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
      
      WORKDIR /app
      
      COPY --from=build /app/target/WalletManager.jar /app/WalletManager.jar
      
      EXPOSE 8080
      
      CMD ["java", "-jar", "WalletManager.jar"]


************************************************************

## how can i ensure that the project is dockerized successfully?

To ensure that your project is successfully Dockerized, you can follow these steps to verify that everything works as expected:

1. Build the Docker Image
   First, ensure that the Docker image for your application is built correctly:


      sudo docker-compose build
If this command completes without errors, it means your Docker image was built successfully.

2. Check the Docker Image
   After the build, check if the image exists by listing the Docker images:


      sudo docker images
You should see the image you just built in the list. Look for something like this:

php

      REPOSITORY             TAG                  IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
      <your_project_name>     latest               <image_id>          <time>              <size>
3. Run the Docker Container
   Next, run the container based on the built image. Since you're using docker-compose, you can run:


      sudo docker-compose up
This command will:

Start the containers defined in your docker-compose.yml file.
Automatically pull necessary base images if they're not available locally.
Start your Spring Boot application inside a container.
If the application starts without errors, it means Docker successfully ran your app.

It sounds like you're saying that your Spring Boot application is running successfully inside a Docker container, but you're not seeing it running inside IntelliJ. That means the application is probably working as expected inside Docker,

4. Verify the Application is Running
   After running the container, check if the Spring Boot app is running by visiting http://localhost:8080 (assuming your app is configured to run on port 8080):

Open a browser and visit http://localhost:8080 (or the relevant URL/port).
If the application loads, it means the container is up and running.
You can also check the logs for any issues or confirmation that the app is running by running:


      sudo docker-compose logs
This will display the logs from your container. Look for messages that indicate your Spring Boot application has started successfully, like:

sql
   
         2025-01-27 13:00:00.000  INFO 1 --- [           main] c.e.w.WalletManagerApplication          : Started WalletManagerApplication in 3.5 seconds (JVM running for 4.0)
5. Test the Application (Optional)
   If your application exposes any REST APIs or has a frontend, you can test them:

Use tools like curl or Postman to send requests to your APIs.
If you have a frontend, try accessing it through the browser and interacting with the app.
6. Check Docker Container Status
   You can also check the status of the running containers:


      sudo docker ps
This will show you all running containers. Ensure your container is listed and running.

7. Verify Cleanup (Optional)
   If you want to ensure that everything works from a clean state, you can remove all containers and rebuild everything. To stop and remove the running containers:


      sudo docker-compose down
Afterward, you can rebuild and restart:


      sudo docker-compose up --build
If all of these steps work without any issues, you can be confident that your project has been successfully Dockerized and is running correctly.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during these steps!

**so when i want to change the project 
and add some feature after the runnig container
i shoul stop and re run the iamge 
or i shorld do mvn clean pachage again**

When you make changes to your project and want them reflected in a Dockerized environment, you do need to follow a specific process to rebuild and redeploy the updated version of your application. Here's how it works:

Steps After Making Changes:
Stop the Running Docker Container:

You should stop the running container first, because Docker is running a specific instance of your application, and changes made to your local code won't be automatically reflected inside the container unless you rebuild it.
You can stop the container with:
bash
Copy
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
You can find the container ID or name using:
bash
Copy

      sudo docker ps
      CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES


      sudo docker ps -a
      CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES

do not forget to have sudo in that instead you will get confused :

      docker ps -a
      CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED      STATUS                      PORTS                       NAMES

see the *sudo* is important

Rebuild the Docker Image:

After making changes to your code (e.g., adding features, fixing bugs), you'll need to rebuild the Docker image to include those changes.
To do this, you'll typically run the following command in the root of your project (where your Dockerfile is located):
bash
Copy

      docker build -t your-image-name .
This will rebuild the image and include your latest code changes.
Restart the Docker Container:

Once the image is rebuilt, you can start a new container based on the updated image:
bash
Copy

      docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name

This starts a new container with your updated application, and you can access it at http://localhost:8080/ (or whatever port you're using).
Do You Need to Run mvn clean package Again?
Yes, you should run mvn clean package if you're building your application locally (without Docker) before building the Docker image. However, if you're using Docker to handle the build process (via a Dockerfile that builds your application from source), you don't need to run mvn clean package manually in most cases.

Here's how it typically works:
If your Dockerfile is set up to build the project (like this):

Dockerfile
   Copy

      FROM maven:3.6.3-jdk-11 AS build
      COPY . /app
      WORKDIR /app
      RUN mvn clean package
The docker build command will execute mvn clean package automatically as part of the image creation process. So, in this case, no need to run mvn clean package manually—Docker will handle it.
